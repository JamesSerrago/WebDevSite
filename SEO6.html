	<h1>Web Development History</h1>
    <div><p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing
industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their
website to advertise and sell products and services to customers.
There are many open source tools for web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish,
LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of
learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the
industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe
Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software,
but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly.</p>

<p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and
 interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web
 services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer.
  This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution.
   Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud,
   Dropbox and Google Drive. These web services allow users to interact with applications
   from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their
   application environment.</p>

<p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development
include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find
and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com
(among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many
consumers. Another example of transformative communication led by web development is the
blog. Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created blog-environments
for individual websites. The increased usage of open-source content management systems and
enterprise content management systems has extended web development's impact at online
interaction and communication.</p>

<p>Web development has also impacted personal networking and marketing. Websites are no
longer simply tools for work or for commerce, but serve more broadly for communication
and social networking. Web sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide users with a platform
o communicate and organizations with a more personal and interactive way to engage the
public.
