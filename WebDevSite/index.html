		<h1>What is Web Development?</h1>
		<div><p>Web developers design and create websites.They are
   responsible for the look of the site. They are also responsible for the site’s
   technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity, which are measures of
   a website’s speed and how much traffic the site can handle. In addition,
   web developers may create content for the site. </p>
   <p>When creating a website, developers have to make their client’s vision a reality.
   They build particular types of websites, such as ecommerce, news, or gaming sites,
   to fit clients’ needs. Different types of websites require different applications.
   For example, a gaming site should be able to handle advanced graphics, whereas an
   ecommerce site would need a payment-processing application. The developer decides
   which applications and designs will best fit the site.</p>
