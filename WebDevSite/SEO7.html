	<h1>Job Outlook</h1>
    <div><p>Employment of web developers is projected to grow 15 percent from 2016 to 2026,
much faster than the average for all occupations.
Employment of web developers is projected to grow as ecommerce continues to expand.
Online purchasing is expected to grow faster than the overall retail industry. As
retail firms expand their online offerings, demand for web developers will grow.
In addition, an increase in the use of mobile devices to search the web will lead to
increased demand for web developers. Instead of designing a website for a desktop computer,
developers will have to create sites that work on mobile devices with many different
screen sizes, leading to more work.</p>

<p>Because websites can be built from anywhere in the world, some web developer jobs may be
moved to countries with lower wages. However, this practice may decline because the cost
of managing web developers in multiple countries can offset the savings to businesses.
Furthermore, web developers must understand cultural nuances that allow webpages to
communicate effectively with users, and domestic web developers are better equipped
for this task, curtailing the work that may be moved to other countries.
